  # CS 450: Operating Systems

This organization is [IIT's CS 450 class](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs450) GitHub home, hosting public repositories containing sample code and private machine problem repositories (shared with students).

If you're a student taking this class, you won't be creating any repositories here manually. Rather, look for [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) invitation links on the [class website](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs450) to accept and clone assignment repositories.
